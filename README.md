# Image classification with deep learning pretrained models

** Project description **
This project aims build image classifiers using various pretrained models such as vgg16, vgg19, or ResNet50 for several image classification problems:

* Dogs vs Cats [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle
* Object classification from [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
* Predicting House numbers using street view house number [dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) 

** Project objectives **
These are wellknown problems but I want to do to:
* Learn the tools and build up skills, knowledge
* Demonstrate capabilities of pretrained models of images from ImageNet to show real world problems
* Have fun
* Discuss insights along the way
* Love to write technical stuff

** Tools ** 
* Python 2.7, Jupyter
* Theano & Tensorflow with Keras wrapper
* NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas,
* AWS: p2.xlarge or g2.xlarge instances for GPU support

** Sources ** The learning, tricks, models are gatherred from various sources on the internet. The primary source is Keras example [library](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples) on GitHub. The second main source
is from this [tutors](http://course.fast.ai/). In fact, this notebook uses resourses, follows and extends lessons learned, and greatly inspired by [Jeremy Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/howardjeremy)'s course.
